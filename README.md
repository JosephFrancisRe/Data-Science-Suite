# Data-Science-Suite
This project is a Data Science Suite designed to take in data from any API and fit a linear regression model for processing. The project uses Machine Learning to generalize the code so it can work with any python library that has a function which returns a DataFrame. The Machine Learning algorithms will select independent variables it believes will make for the best model. Then the program outputs relevant statistical information for the user to review in both csv and visulation formats.
